(defn describe-topology
  "Returns a map of all the streams within a topology. the passed in topology
  object must have a `describe` method, meaning it is one of:
  Kafka >= 1.1 : https://kafka.apache.org/21/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/Topology.html
  Kafka <  1.1 : https://kafka.apache.org/10/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/TopologyBuilder.html#internalTopologyBuilder
  Both work the same regards the graphing.

  The data reurned is in the form:

  {:topology          <the application id for this topology, i.e. its consumer group name>
  :id                <a unique UUID for this topology, deterministic from its name>
  :graphs            <a list of all the stream graphs in the topology>}

  Where each stream graph is:

  {:type :stream
  :name  <the name that kafka gives this stream>
  :id    <a unique UUID for the stream, deterministic from the encosing topology and its stream name>
  :nodes <a list of all the nodes in the graph>
  :edges <a list of all the edges in the graph>}

  ... And edges and nodes are represented as:

  {:id   <a deterministic UUID for the node>
  :name <the name as assigned by kafka>
  :type <the type - processor, store, topic &c.>}

  {:from    <the :name of the node the edge comes from>
  :from-id <the :id of the node the edge comes from>
  :to      <the :name of the node the edge goes to>
  :to-id   <the :id of the node the edge goes to>}

  All Ids are generated using v5 UUIDs, and are guaranteed globally unique where objects are
  distinct, and guaranteed globally equal where objects are the same.
